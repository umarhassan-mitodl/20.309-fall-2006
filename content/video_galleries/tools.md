Video Tutorial on the 20.309 AFM
--------------------------------

Following the Fall 2006 term, these videos were produced from a series of AFM tutorial sessions led by Maxim Shusteff to prepare other instructors, staff and students for the next offering of 20.309. The tutorials explore the theory and practice of using the lab AFM, which differs somewhat from standard commercial AFM systems.
